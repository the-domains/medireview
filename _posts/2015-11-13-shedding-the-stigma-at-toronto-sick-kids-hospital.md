description: "The subject of marijuana is tricky enough as it is without introducing children into the mix, but it's necessary because there are significant benefits to be had. Granted it's anecdotal, but it is becoming more and more documented, and now even the American Association of Pediatrics is recommending to the Drug Enforcement Agency that cannabis should be removed from the highly restrictive Schedule I classification so more research can be performed."
